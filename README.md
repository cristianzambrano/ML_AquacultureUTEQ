# ML_AquacultureUTEQ

This repository contains code and resources for the project **"Predictive Model to Estimate the Weight of Native Fish Based on Physiological Parameters"** developed at the Universidad Técnica Estatal de Quevedo (UTEQ). The main goal of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to estimate the weight of native fish species, specifically Vieja Azul (\textit{Andinocara rivulatus}), using physiological and morphometric data.

## Repository Contents

- **ML_AquacultureUTEQ1.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook that contains all the steps for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results. This notebook demonstrates the use of machine learning algorithms to predict fish weight based on collected physiological parameters.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes steps for cleaning and preparing the dataset, handling missing values, and scaling features for optimal performance in machine learning models.
- **Model Training**: Various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Ridge Regression are implemented to identify the best model for weight prediction.
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance metrics including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² are calculated to evaluate model accuracy.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides scatter plots, correlation matrices, and other visual tools to illustrate the relationship between the physiological parameters and the predicted weight.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the notebook, you need the following installed on your local machine:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt` (or install them directly via the notebook)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cristianzambrano/ML_AquacultureUTEQ.git
   cd ML_AquacultureUTEQ
